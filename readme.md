# Townhouse Scraper

## A competitive rental market web-scraper that pulls townhomes that meet specific criteria from Avalon Communities and emails them to a specified user.

### Uses puppeteer to navigate to the specific website, then runs a javascript command in the console to pull the data. 

### The data is stored directly on window object so we have access to it. 

### Eliminates the need of checking the website manually and periodically since this automated tool will email filtered results to you. 

### Runs on an hourly cron job
