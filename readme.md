# Housing Scraper

Housing Scraper is a web scraping tool designed for the competitive rental market. It efficiently pulls townhomes that meet specific criteria from Avalon Communities and sends them via email to a specified user. This eliminates the need for manual and periodic website checks, as the tool automates the process and delivers filtered results to your inbox. The scraper utilizes Puppeteer to navigate to the Avalon Communities website and runs a JavaScript command in the console to extract the desired data.
